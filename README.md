* I've created a **Machine Learning** based crop prediction model.
* It uses **Soil Metrics** (nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, pH) and **Weather Data** (temperature, humidity, rainfall) to precisely recommend the optimal crop for a specific field.
* The dataset comprises varied soil measurements from different fields, with the 'label' column indicating the best crop based on these measurements.
* The project aims to develop a powerful multi-class classification model, integrating weather data to enhance predictive accuracy.
