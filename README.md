# Crop-Advisor
I've created a machine learning based crop prediction model./
It uses soil metrics (nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, pH) and weather data (temperature, humidity, rainfall) to precisely recommend the optimal crop for a specific field./ 
The dataset comprises varied soil measurements from different fields, with the 'label' column indicating the best crop based on these measurements./ 
The project aims to develop a powerful multi-class classification model, integrating weather data to enhance predictive accuracy.
